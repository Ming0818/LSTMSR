# LSTMSR
Speaker Recognition with low-level Long Short-Term Memory for assignment
Trains a manually-coded LSTM model to identify human voice using [TIMIT corpus](https://github.com/philipperemy/timit) as dataset and optimizes accuracy by tweaking learning rate and number of units

Currently using Python 3.6.4

External packages:

```
None
```

- Place raw audio files in raw/
- Converted audio files are stored in converted/
- Save/load pickles of trained LSTM models in model/
